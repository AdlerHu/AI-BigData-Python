document providing information to the Python community, or describing
a new feature for Python or its processes or environment.  The PEP

rationale for the feature.

Ps to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python.  The PEP

PEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
